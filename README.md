# airbnb-data_analyst
Project data analysis of Airbnb Vancouver 
I divided the project in 3 steps Data Engineering / NLP / Visualization 
You will find in the carpet 9 files and the order are:

1- Airbnb-van_projedct.ipynb 
   listings.csv
   
2- Airbnb-van-NLP.ipynb
   data_airbnb_engineered.csv
   
3- Airbnb-van_visualization.ipynb
   data_airbnb_readyforvisuals.csv

The other 3 are 2 html generated from the project that you will be able to see it and a JSON used for geo-plotting
Any suggestions, ideas or alternative or discuss for this or new project just hit me. I will be glad to sit and talk
